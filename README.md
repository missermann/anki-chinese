# Anki cards for learning Chinese

I created several Anki decks to help me learn Chinese. Book1 to 5 follow a standard teaching approach from Taiwan. They include vocabulary, grammar, proverbs and some additional information. The characters are in traditional form.                                        
In contrast to conventional thinking, I consider traditional characters easier to learn because the semantic and phonetic components are more distinct than in simplified form where inconsistencies and abstraction obstruct learning. When learning character, use *mnemonic* techniques! Traditional characters are perfect for that. The etymology and components (semantic/radicals and phonetic) provide ample opportunity for developing memorable stories. For instance, I remember the character 矮 (short) by thinking that “being short is good for *women* because it is hard to hit them with *arrows* in a field of *grain*”. That is of course ridiculous but the more ridiculous such mnemonic is the easier is it to remember them. After knowing a number of such components, your mind will much easier retain new characters.                                   
For general language learning advice, read **Fluent Forever** by *Gabriel Wyner*. I hope that people use to decks as foundation for personalized or general changes, such as adding pictures, personal memories and etymology.  **Pleco** and [yellowbridge](https://www.yellowbridge.com/chinese/dictionary.php) are good dictionaries with detailed  etymology.  A good monolingual dictionary is [MOEdict](https://www.moedict.tw/) from Taiwan.                                                   
For listing exercise, I recommend dictations. Buy a children’s book (elementary school age) and its audiobook! Regarding TV, Chinese and Taiwanese TV series are mostly as bad as European ones. Hopefully, Netflix will change that.  It is thus a real pity that American TV series cannot be dubbed into Chinese. Two good Chinese-language shows are  [A Touch of Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Touch_of_Green) and [Empresses in the Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empresses_in_the_Palace). Animes and cartoons are good alternatives. I like Japanese or American ones that are dubbed into Chinese, like the later seasons of the Simpsons, Stars Wars Clone Wars and Chibi Maruko-chan. A good anime production from Taiwan is [Taiwan Bar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRNsHFT7BFoAPBcuAa5sgEQ) with much fascinating details about history and culture of Taiwan, but it is super fast and the text is quite sophisticated. Besides Chinese propaganda channels and boring teaching videos, there is Chinese-language radio: [Radio Taiwan International](https://www.rti.org.tw/), [Voice of America](https://www.voachinese.com/) and [Radio France Internationale](https://www.rfi.fr/tw/). It is a shame that the BBC has no Chinese-language (Mandarin) radio service.                                       
For reading, besides children’s book, I enjoy mangas. I like about mangas that they transcribe spoken language. Unfortunately, Chinese mangas are not so interesting. Therefore, I recommend Chinese translation of Japanese mangas like the [Space Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Brothers_(manga)).                                     

Please post a issue for mistakes in the decks and new interesting learning material!
